|project_name| documentation
============================

This is the documentation for |project_name| |release|, last updated
|today|.


Introduction
------------

This documentation describes a git repository that you can use as a
template for new C projects.  It makes a number of assumptions about
which build tools and third-party libraries you're going to use, and
about how the code will be organized within your repository.  Some of
these decisions can be overridden; others cannot, at least not without a
good amount of work.  This template is not meant to be all things to all
people!  If you disagree with any of the decisions, feel free to fork
the template and modify it to your heart's content.
